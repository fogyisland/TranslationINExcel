# TranslationINExcel
在翻译过程中，我们通常需要访问网页或使用API接口。虽然API调用通常需要一定的编程知识（例如Python）来构建界面，但在当前项目中，我们通过直接在Excel中集成翻译功能，简化了操作流程。用户只需通过文件即可调用翻译API，轻松实现翻译需求。


During the translation process, we often need to access web pages or utilize API interfaces. Although API calls typically require some programming knowledge (such as Python) to construct the interface, in the current project, we have streamlined the operation by integrating the translation function directly within Excel. Users can now easily invoke the translation API through the file, effortlessly fulfilling their translation needs.
